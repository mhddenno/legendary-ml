**<h3> Classification models </h3>**
<h4> Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category.

**<h3> Logistic Regression </h3>**

-   Logistic Regression is a linear classifier. 
-   Despite its name, logistic - regression is used for binary classification problems, where the output is a binary variable (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false).

-   The logistic regression algorithm applies a linear transformation to the input features
-   Then passes the result through a logistic (sigmoid) function to obtain the final output. 
-   Logistic regression applies the logistic function to produce values between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.

- $$  P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n)}}  $$

where:
- $$ \(P(Y=1)\) $$ is the probability of the event \(Y\) being class 1, 
- $$ \(e\) $$ is the base of the natural logarithm,
- $$ \(b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\) $$ are the coefficients,
- $$ \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) $$ are the input features.
