-   [Show](../../res/Naive%20bayes.pdf)
-   $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} $$ 
-   $ P(A|B) $ Posterior Probability is the posterior probability of event A given that event B has occurred.
-   $ P(B) $ Marginal Likelihood is the prior probability of event A (the probability of A before considering the new evidence B).
-   $ P(B|A) $ Likelihood is the likelihood of event B given that event A has occurred.
-   $ P(A) $ Prior Probability is the probability of event B (the total probability of B, regardless of A).
-   $ P(X) $ if x is the new points
